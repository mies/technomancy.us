We have meetings every two weeks, and so the customer was very closely involved in the developing-process. What i have learned is, that its very difficult to find out, what the customer and our team had appointed eg. four weeks ago, if both are not documenting the meeting-points and agreements very exactly. so, one thing we had tried is to record the meeting with a dictaphone, so that the whole team can listen everytime to what was discussed at the meetings. another thing what i think is, if the customer is involved that closely, you save more time in the developing-process, because things can be corrected fast enough, so that you not have to make big changes at the end of the project. Thanks again for showing another approach to that topic :)\r<br \/>\n\r<br \/>\nBest regards,\r<br \/>\nFabian"}
