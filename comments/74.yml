    <p>When you open it up,  can you open it flat?  With most laptops I can&#8217;t get my reading glasses close enough to the bottom of the screen to read the small text without putting my chin through the keyboard.  If I can fold it flat I&#8217;d be able to read it like any flat surface.
    Thank you.</p>

If you&#8217;re having a problem with small text,  it would probably be more prudent to (a) use programs that allow text size to be increased or (b) install screen magnifier software.</p>"
