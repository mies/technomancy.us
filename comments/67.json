It looks really cool, but it seems to mostly be cosmetic; it doesn&#8217;t support any of the cool Lispy things that Ruby lacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<p>That&#8217;s basically the converse of what I&#8217;m trying to do. I&#8217;d like to leverage the years and years of head start that Lisp has had in the compiler arena and put a more easily-grokkable Rubylicious face on it. Obviously to support things like macros, the dialect will have to be a superset of Ruby, but that&#8217;s getting ahead of myself.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<p>Gah! No <em>fancy<\/em> stuff?! Will remedy immediately.<\/p>"}
