I would have thought because of that you'd be used to seeing standards-compliant,  correct sites render incorrectly. Get used to it."

    I don't know you,  and haven't read any of your blog (yet). I followed a link here from the IE8 Acid2 announcement,  where you expressed your personal hatred for Microsoft. <br />
    <br />
    I think it's kinda funny that you'd be so down on Microsoft and their free browsers when you can't even make your own personal website work. If your sidebar were any longer,  I would've thought that your site had no content at all. <br />
    <br />
    Ironic.
