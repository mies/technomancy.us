I plan to download and study\/use it.\r<br \/>\n\r<br \/>\nYour links to behave.el, both at this web page and at &lt;http:\/\/technomancy.us\/72&gt;, are not working for me.  The following appears to be the correct link:\r<br \/>\n\r<br \/>\nhttp:\/\/dev.technomancy.us\/index.cgi\/browser\/dotfiles\/.emacs.d\/behave\r<br \/>\n\r<br \/>\nP.S., Does technomancy.us not support spell checking, or is that considered to be too distracting due to the number of jargon terms?\r<br \/>\n"}
