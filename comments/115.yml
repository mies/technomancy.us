  content: +1, Insightful<br /><br />I think your examples show some people like to get a menu (reach for the mouse) and pick and choose, while others like to start the dialog from their end (M-x) and ask about the special of the day. OMG mystery meat. :-)<br /><br />Isn't Textmate over there the new Emacs? &gt;:-]<br /><br />On the Windows side (yes I'm from there), either I came too late to the porting party or the Emacs UI is just not much of a problem, since Windows UI itself it just so non-unixy I just throw up my hands and exclaim &quot;Think Different&quot;.:-/ The recent change in Emacs 22.x to allow file copies from Windows Explorer to a directory shown by a Dired Buffer (via &quot;drag and drop&quot;) seemed to be an anti-improvement IMHO, but I'm sure someone appreciates it. Still I like reaching for Eclipse or VS200x for the &quot;intellisense&quot; visualization. It just works and sometimes I'm in that mood to hit Control-Spacebar. 14 years and I still haven't set this up in my Emacs (I assume, without hesitation, that it is possible).<br /><br />One thing I would like to know is if Emacs Customize should really, really be avoided. My Customize vs hand-pref ratio in my .emacs is probably 20%:80%, and I feel its convenient for what it does, except for the UI which is really awful. The font face and color selection is just hit and miss. Someone, please, post a &quot;Emacs Customize considered harmful&quot; or &quot;E.C. is full of lose&quot;..

  content: Interesting points, but they're both invalid when compared to TextMate. Yes, you have tabs with TextMate, but you have a shortcut to open (with a few keystrokes) any file in a project (cmd+T). And it's just as easy (or easier) to modify the behaviour of the app through the Bundle editor.<br /><br />I'd really like to see compelling reasons to switch from TextMate to emacs, if only to suggest improvements for TextMate or other code text-editors.<br /><br />The big problem I have with Emacs is that it is hard to get into for novices.. I've tried myself at a few occasions. TextMate (among others) makes it easy for novices to get into, and allow you to discover each functionality incrementally.

    Audun: I think you're missing the point; it's not "Program X is missing feature Y", it's "People expect programs to work a certain way and don't realize when something better is available". That said, there is at least one big flaw with what you've said.<br /><br />
    &gt; <i>And it's just as easy (or easier) to modify the behaviour of the app through the Bundle editor</i>.<br /><br />
    The problem with this is that you can't extend it using the same tools that it was written in. The fact that the author says, "look, here&mdash;we have a way for you extend the program, but it's not the way <b>I</b> extend the program" means there are a lot of things you just can't do. I've tried to get folks to support <a href='http://augment.rubyforge.org'>Augment</a> in Textmate, and it's simply not possible because the required functionality is just not exposed. That whole notion is rather offensive to begin with; it puts the author in a high holy place that is inaccessible to the users. Users should demand better of the programs they use.<br /><br />
    Piyo: In my experience, I haven't found anything customize is good for, though some have said it's good for modifying font faces. (I just use color-theme.) My problem with it is that everything it does can be done better by writing real code instead of having code written for you. It lets you alter the behaviour of libraries without looking at the code for those libraries, but why should you be hesitant to look at the code to begin with?<br /><br />
    Just my thoughts though; maybe there's something there I'm missing.

  content: The funny thing about Emacs not being Mac-like enough is that the default text widgets in the windowing system support things like C-a, C-e, and C-k. There's more Emacs in OS X than most folks realize.
