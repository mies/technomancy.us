    	<p>I don&#8217;t run that repository,  so there&#8217;s not a lot I can do about it. However,  I packaged it up in a tarball if you want to grab that: </p>

    <p>I got the tarball,  and installed it,  but keep getting &#8220;calendarIfFormat not defined &#8221; javascript errors on the page. Any suggestions?</p>

    <p>Unfortunetly,  I cannot download the plugin from the provided url.. (tried it some days.. but everytime I just got an Apache error)
    Maybe you can offer another link to get the plugin?</p>
    
    
    	<p>Thanks a lot
