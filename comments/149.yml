    Great work, Phil. So now we don't need another dev-dependency and everything gets started with a single command.
    
    A serious victory for veterans and new-comers alike. Thanks for all your hard work.

    Phil, thanks a lot for all your work!
    
    Now, I have just tried it and it gave me an error: 
      /bin/bash: lein: command not found
    
    Obviously, something is running a shell without reading .profile or .bashrc or something like that. I copied lein to /usr/sbin (I am on a MacOs now) and restarted it. 
    
    Now it complains about function first which does not exist in elisp. Replaced first with car and second with cadr and restarted. 
    
    Now it does not seem to finish launching swank, and I launched slime-connect manually. The default port did not work, but *Process list* tells me that lein jack-in was passed number 44916 which I passed on to the slime-connect and it worked.
    
    What did I do wrong?
    
    Thanks!

    The path thing is a well-known problem with using GUI Emacs on Macs. There's technically a fix, but it involves editing a plist.xml file; it's probably better to just keep things on the default system path.
    
    &quot;first&quot; is defined in cl.el, which is required as the first thing in clojure-mode; I have no idea how it would be possible for that to be missing. Perhaps you're on a fork like Aquamacs? This has only been tested on GNU Emacs.

    Thanks for this, works beautifully, and makes everything a bit simpler, esp. with the version conflicts between slime and swank. 
    
    I was using lein swank with slime-connect (which I use with other lisps still).
    
    Unfortunately it did not fix the bug I discovered, actually it has a more final consequence now.  I will file a bug report with swank-clojure
