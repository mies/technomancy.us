    Great work, Phil. So now we don't need another dev-dependency and everything gets started with a single command.
    
    A serious victory for veterans and new-comers alike. Thanks for all your hard work.

    Phil, thanks a lot for all your work!
    
    Now, I have just tried it and it gave me an error: 
      /bin/bash: lein: command not found
    
    Obviously, something is running a shell without reading .profile or .bashrc or something like that. I copied lein to /usr/sbin (I am on a MacOs now) and restarted it. 
    
    Now it complains about function first which does not exist in elisp. Replaced first with car and second with cadr and restarted. 
    
    Now it does not seem to finish launching swank, and I launched slime-connect manually. The default port did not work, but *Process list* tells me that lein jack-in was passed number 44916 which I passed on to the slime-connect and it worked.
    
    What did I do wrong?
    
    Thanks!

    The path thing is a well-known problem with using GUI Emacs on Macs. There's technically a fix, but it involves editing a plist.xml file; it's probably better to just keep things on the default system path.
    
    &quot;first&quot; is defined in cl.el, which is required as the first thing in clojure-mode; I have no idea how it would be possible for that to be missing. Perhaps you're on a fork like Aquamacs? This has only been tested on GNU Emacs.

    Thanks for this, works beautifully, and makes everything a bit simpler, esp. with the version conflicts between slime and swank. 
    
    I was using lein swank with slime-connect (which I use with other lisps still).
    
    Unfortunately it did not fix the bug I discovered, actually it has a more final consequence now.  I will file a bug report with swank-clojure

    Thanks so much for all your work on Emacs and Clojure! This worked for me but I hit a small snag: it seems that Swing code gets locked up somehow. Is this a known issue? I found this thread from 2008: http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/6c195c35ae9a7eb8
    
    I was trying the ants.clj demo. When I compile the whole file with C-c C-k everything compiles and the Swing window opens up, but everything's frozen. I think that it's not just the UI code since when I print out the `world` in the SLIME REPL it looks like nothing's moving, but I could be wrong...
    
    When I do the same thing after running Clojure as an *inferior-lisp*, the demo works, and it works from the plain clj REPL too.
    
    If this is a known issue, it's not that big a deal but does anyone know a workaround for playing with Swing code using SLIME? If it's not a known issue, I can submit some more details as an issue on Github if it would help.
    
    I'm on Mac OS X, but I tried it on Ubuntu 11.04 and saw the same behavior. Using GNU Emacs in both cases, and also using the (truly excellent) emacs-starter-kit.
    
    Anyway, thanks again, awesome work.

    Hey, hopefully the other comment went through and is awaiting moderation so this one will have some context.
    
    I tried using swank-clojure 1.3.2 and it worked, there was no issue with locked threads in Swing code. The ant demo worked as expected.
    
    Thanks again!
