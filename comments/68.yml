    <p>Funny,  because I had this jingle running through my head all the time while writing MozLab&#8217;s <span class='caps'>REPL</span>,  about how nice it would be to embed some incarnation of Lisp in Mozilla,  one that could compile  to C,  and use it to write future components of the platform,  gradually morphing Firefox into a Lisp Machine for the Internet Age.</p>
    
    
    	<p>Of course,  now that Javascript will get a <span class='caps'>JIT</span> compiler,  and there is even a <a href='http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roadmap/archives/2007/02/threads_suck.html'>hint of Erlang-style concurrency</a> (!),  all that might be left to do would be a parser for S-exp syntax and a macro compiler&#8230;</p>
    
    
    	<p>Ok.  I clearly <em>still</em> have that jingle.</p>
