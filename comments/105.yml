  content: Phil, this is a really thoughtful post. I think you're spot-on about the potential GitHub has for building a kind of developer's social network. To me this is so much more compelling that current apps like Facebook or LinkedIn. Those seem to be focused on building the connections, but once you have them built, then what? What gives GitHub such potential is that it's setting out to solve some real problems--the social network bit is really a side-effect more than anything else. Building an effective rapport and workflow with collaborators is the primary goal. --AV
