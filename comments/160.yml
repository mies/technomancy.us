    It drives my 28-inch external display just fine over the
    micro-HDMI port, but I don't know if it can drive both that and
    the VGA port at the same time. For battery life, powertop
    estimates put it at about 4 hours at normal indoor brightness, but
    since I haven't used it unplugged continuously for that long I'm
    not sure I should trust it. I did have to add a few kernel options
    to improve the power-saving, in particular the rc6 setting
