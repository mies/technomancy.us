    Forgot to mention this:  this code requires the twitter gem. Also:  getting Pidgin and Ruby-DBus working together nicely requires a version of Ruby-DBus that's *newer* than 0.1.1. As of this writing,  that means getting it from SVN: \u003Cbr /\u003E
    \u003Cbr /\u003E
    svn co svn: //trac.luon.net/ruby-dbus/trunk ruby-dbus
