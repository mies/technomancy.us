Seems very functional, meaning antithetical to how object-oriented programming is supposed to work. Of course Ruby is full of stuff like that, so whatever. Paradigm wars aside, I have two comments:\r<br \/>\n\r<br \/>\n1) Restoring the old methods should happen in an ensure clause, in case something raises an exception in the block.\r<br \/>\n\r<br \/>\n2) This doesn't appear thread safe. Yeah I know, who cares about threads in Ruby?\r<br \/>\n\r<br \/>\nBy the way, this should be a little easier in Rubinius."}
