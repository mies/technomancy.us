The manuals I've looked at haven't been any help.  \r<br \/>\n\r<br \/>\nI suppose I should look at this as an interesting puzzle, imagine myself as Richard Feynman at Los Alamos receiving eshell in the mail from a friend back home.  Right.\r<br \/>\n\r<br \/>\nSo is there actually a manual or info, or help text somewhere that indicates how to stick things together using eshell?  If so, perhaps you could point me at it?"}
