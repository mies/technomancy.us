  content: Yeah, I've also been pretty impressed with Clojure. It makes it dead easy to make minor tweaks to your code to make it more performant.<br /><br />Don't forget to checkout Stuart Halloway's Progamming Clojure book from the Pragmatic Programmers (http://pragprog.com/titles/shcloj/programming-clojure). It's helped me out immensely learning the langauge.
