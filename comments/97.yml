    The Columbus/Cincinnati group includes Doug Alcorn,  Jim Weirich,  Rob Biedenharn,  Joe O'Brien,  Craig Muth,  (and more).  I think there were about 10 or 12 of us at the last meeting.<br />

    I love the js lambda stuff,  though I like to have point in the function body: <br />
    <br />
    &lt;code&gt;<br />
    (defun my-javascript-lambda () (interactive) (insert &quot;function () {\n};&quot;)<br />
      (backward-char 3)<br />
      (newline-and-indent))<br />
    <br />
    &lt;/code&gt;

    Phil, <br />

    This is great that you're spearheading this effort.  There is certainly a lot of interest in emacs from the rails/ruby folks,  especially here in Columbus.  We've got our own group dedicated to the integration between the 2.  http://groups.google.com/group/emacs-unite  Currently,  we're investigating el4r a little more,  but there is some good emacs-lisp chops within the group as well.
