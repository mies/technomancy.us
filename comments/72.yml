    <p>Evan:  I&#8217;ve looked at that; yeah. It looks really cool,  but it seems to mostly be cosmetic; it doesn&#8217;t support any of the cool Lispy things that Ruby lacks.</p>
    
    
    	<p>That&#8217;s basically the converse of what I&#8217;m trying to do. I&#8217;d like to leverage the years and years of head start that Lisp has had in the compiler arena and put a more easily-grokkable Rubylicious face on it. Obviously to support things like macros,  the dialect will have to be a superset of Ruby,  but that&#8217;s getting ahead of myself.</p>
    
    
    	<p>Gah! No <em>fancy</em> stuff?! Will remedy immediately.</p>

    <p>Have you looked at <a href='http://zabor.org/taw/rlisp/'>RLisp</a>?</p>
    
    
    	<p>It runs its interpreter on top of the CRuby interpreter,  so all the Ruby object stuff gets tossed right to real Ruby.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You can do fancy stuff with your comment.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Writing in Common Lisp a compiler with full Ruby language semantics is quite some work.</p>
    
    
    	<p>I did it for Ruby&#8217;s neighbour Python (project CLPython). Language-wise,  Python is a subset of CL,  in the sense that a big part of the effort is &#8220;connecting dots&#8221; between the two. Conceptually easy,  just a lot of work : )</p>
    
    
    	<p>I think a CL compiler for Ruby will require similar effort.</p>
