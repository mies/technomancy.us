  content: "@riffraff:  the Helma framework provides an automatic hierarchical default behavior,  but there are various handlers like &quot;onRequest&quot; and &quot;getChildElement&quot; which can override the default and allow you to implement your own mechanism wherever the default becomes restrictive."

Reg. the the testing framework:  could you elaborate a bit more on what you're missing resp. what makes it inconvenient to use? being the one who developed jala.Test i'm really interested in your opinion (i must confess that i have no experience with unit testing in rails,  apart from skimming the docs)."
