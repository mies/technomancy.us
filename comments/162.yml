  content: What about having a single emacs daemon running and having everyone connect to it with emacsclient? Would that allow everyone to edit at once (like Google Docs)? Obviously I've never tried editing the same Emacs buffer simultaneously from different terminals. I wonder how well it would work.

  content: "Ryan: that would certainly allow everyone to edit at the same time, but it's usually not what you want. If you have a discussion going on, you want a single point to focus on. It's really hard to track what's happening if you have multiple independent edits happening simultaneously. While it's technically feasible, the concurrency issues reside in the human mind rather than in the software in this case. =)"

  content: Obviously I love Emacs but I wonder if a web-based IDE (like the recently launched Cloud 9) offers a faster entry in for this sort of coding session? Of course even better would be some sort of open access where everyone could follow but in their editor of choice!
