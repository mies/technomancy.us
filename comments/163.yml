  content: Many thanks to you and Tim for working on this project.  I'll probably be holding off for a little while but I appreciate a good alternative to SLIME.  It was always a bit of a square peg in a round hole.

  content: Switched to nREPL a couple of weeks ago, and while yes it's not SLIME, it does feel a lot nicer to use. I'm very happy with it so far.
