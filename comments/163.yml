  content: Many thanks to you and Tim for working on this project.  I'll probably be holding off for a little while but I appreciate a good alternative to SLIME.  It was always a bit of a square peg in a round hole.

  content: Switched to nREPL a couple of weeks ago, and while yes it's not SLIME, it does feel a lot nicer to use. I'm very happy with it so far.

  content: As creator of swank-clojure, I'm a little sad to see it die. But I'm very happy to see that it's being replaced by something designed/maintainable instead of hacked about just to scratch an itch. Thanks for keeping it alive all this time and I look forward to the great work coming out of nrepl.el

    I have translated slime doc into Chinese, and I found it very powerful.
    
    I hope oneday nREPL can be really cool and powerful like Slime.
