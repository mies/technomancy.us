    Hi Phil,
    
    There seems to be some bug in Slamhound.  Trying to run it on a file with dependencies on functions with names like extended-= or extended-list-= is failing with error messages like:
    
    Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.Exception: Couldn't resolve extended- (NO_SOURCE_FILE:1)
    
    I recommend you try to run it on src/midje/fakes.clj from the Midje source code, which is the file causing the problems.
    
    Best,
    Alex
