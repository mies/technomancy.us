  content: "I switched from wmii to dwm 7 (or something) months ago and wow. If you like wmii's minimalism philosophy, you'll like dwm even more! The fact that you have to modify config.h and then 'make &amp;&amp; make install' maye sound a bit silly but it is not, since you generaly don't change it that much. Also, the way you can customize your bar is just awesome. It simply read any input on STDIN and display it on the bar. Here is how I assigns 'alt+ctrl+n' to mpc next : {MODKEY|ShiftMask,             XK_n,      spawn,          &quot;exec mpc next&quot; } Anyway, I am done with the propaganda. RDoc TextInfo sounds awesome. Really. I mean, ri sucks. qri is fine but not perfect. P.S. : could yoi increase the size of the textarea? I had to use vim to write that comment"

  content: "Oh yea RDoc Texinfo. I have love/hate rel with info, but I suppose the hate comes from &quot;man gnuprog ?!?no details?!? info gnuprog&quot;. Wait a minute, what's available in ri format? ;-) And I'm on Windows, but I like to know about stuff like xbindkeys. The equivalent program, called AutoHotKey, has something like brainfuck for a scripting/config language. o_O Oh BTW, have you evaluated braid (nee: gitson)?"
