  content: I've been using emacs for 15 years and just discovered ESK a few nights ago.  Outstanding work.  I ditched my beloved .emacs and started from scratch (easier since I mostly work on clojure these days).  Anyway, thanks, and you should really consider renaming it.  I had ignored it previously due to the name.  It's more of a modular configuration framework for emacs that comes with some nice stuff prepackaged.<br /><br />One more thing, you say that the user's config is in init.el, but why not mention that it's probably better to put it in .emacs.d/username/username.el.  I was thinking off adding exactly this to the documentation the otherday since I had to track it down in one of the git commit entries.<br /><br />Anyway, thanks again.  Great stuff.  Rename it!

  content: Nice tutorial.  In my SLIME the shortcut to change namespace is ,i rather than ,p; is this a typo?

  content: Really great tutorial :) Helped me understand what all those parts of clojure-mode are for. I had *no idea* before reading this blog post.<br /><br />Can't use the emacs-starter-kit though, there's a bug in it that makes it unusable (at least for me since I don't know how to fix it myself). Displays &quot;paredit void&quot; after starting emacs and big parts of the config aren't loaded. Was fixed 2 days ago in the chicken-or-egg commit I think but on the same day the error returned in new commits :p My uninformed guess would be that moving paredit from elpa-to-submit to elpa has something to do with it, or at least that commit.

    <br />Bertrand: Thanks. I've had a couple other people suggest a rename, but nobody has come up with a better name. Also, renaming can be very disorienting to new users; it's very hard to update all pointers to the old name. Generally the Starter Kit is named at new users since most old Emacs hands are very reluctant to part with their existing config. A new name would be nice, but I'm not sure it's feasible right now.

  content: I could get everything working on Mac/Linux, but on WinXP, I'm not able to properly compile clj files. C-c C-k says it is compiling but doesn't work. Any hints?

  content: Thanks a million for all the work you've put in all of this. I started playing around with emacs and clojure at about the same time. The learning curve is a bit steep, but the information and code you post really helps a lot.<br /><br />Looking forward to your post on clojure projects. I'm having some problems setting the classpath in emacs/slime correctly, so I'll stay tuned.<br /><br />cheers!

  content: I decided to junk my old .emacs file and start from scratch using ELPA to install clojure, slime + swank. It worked perfectly the first time, I typed M-x slime and had clojure running without problems.<br /><br />Unfortunately the information the ELPA install told me to add to my .emacs file was not sufficient to load everything on subsequent startups. I still haven't figured out exactly what the install process did to get clojure to be the default lisp, but I did have to add the following to my .emacs:<br /><br />(add-to-list 'load-path &quot;~/../swank-clojure&quot;)<br />(add-to-list 'load-path &quot;~/../slime/contrib&quot;)<br />(add-to-list 'load-path &quot;~/../slime&quot;)<br />(require 'slime)<br /><br />(autoload 'clojure-mode &quot;clojure-mode&quot; &quot;foo&quot; t)<br />(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(&quot;\\.clj$&quot; . clojure-mode)<br /><br />ELPA for installing slime/clojure could be so great, it's too bad there's this tiny bit of configuration information missing.

  content: "VS: Sorry, I don't know how compiling works on Windows.\r<br />\r<br />Peter: the stuff you added to your .emacs file is almost exactly what the clojure-slime-config function does. Maybe if you set the <tt>clojure-src-root</tt> variable? I've had reports that for some reason on OS X that function doesn't work, but unfortunately I can't test on that platform. If you figure anything out please let me know."
