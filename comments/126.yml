  content: I've been using emacs for 15 years and just discovered ESK a few nights ago.  Outstanding work.  I ditched my beloved .emacs and started from scratch (easier since I mostly work on clojure these days).  Anyway, thanks, and you should really consider renaming it.  I had ignored it previously due to the name.  It's more of a modular configuration framework for emacs that comes with some nice stuff prepackaged.<br /><br />One more thing, you say that the user's config is in init.el, but why not mention that it's probably better to put it in .emacs.d/username/username.el.  I was thinking off adding exactly this to the documentation the otherday since I had to track it down in one of the git commit entries.<br /><br />Anyway, thanks again.  Great stuff.  Rename it!

  content: Really great tutorial :) Helped me understand what all those parts of clojure-mode are for. I had *no idea* before reading this blog post.<br /><br />Can't use the emacs-starter-kit though, there's a bug in it that makes it unusable (at least for me since I don't know how to fix it myself). Displays &quot;paredit void&quot; after starting emacs and big parts of the config aren't loaded. Was fixed 2 days ago in the chicken-or-egg commit I think but on the same day the error returned in new commits :p My uninformed guess would be that moving paredit from elpa-to-submit to elpa has something to do with it, or at least that commit.

    Brian: Turns out <kbd>!p</kbd> and <kbd>i</kbd> are aliases of each other; I missed the <kbd>!</kbd>, but <kbd>i</kbd> is better; thanks.
    <br />
    <br />Bertrand: Thanks. I've had a couple other people suggest a rename, but nobody has come up with a better name. Also, renaming can be very disorienting to new users; it's very hard to update all pointers to the old name. Generally the Starter Kit is named at new users since most old Emacs hands are very reluctant to part with their existing config. A new name would be nice, but I'm not sure it's feasible right now.

The learning curve is a bit steep, but the information and code you post really helps a lot.<br /><br />Looking forward to your post on clojure projects. I'm having some problems setting the classpath in emacs/slime correctly, so I'll stay tuned.<br /><br />cheers!

  content: I decided to junk my old .emacs file and start from scratch using ELPA to install clojure, slime + swank. It worked perfectly the first time, I typed M-x slime and had clojure running without problems.<br /><br />Unfortunately the information the ELPA install told me to add to my .emacs file was not sufficient to load everything on subsequent startups. I still haven't figured out exactly what the install process did to get clojure to be the default lisp, but I did have to add the following to my .emacs:<br /><br />(add-to-list 'load-path &quot;~/../swank-clojure&quot;)<br />(add-to-list 'load-path &quot;~/../slime/contrib&quot;)<br />(add-to-list 'load-path &quot;~/../slime&quot;)<br />(require 'slime)<br /><br />(autoload 'clojure-mode &quot;clojure-mode&quot; &quot;foo&quot; t)<br />(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(&quot;\\.clj$&quot; . clojure-mode)<br /><br />ELPA for installing slime/clojure could be so great, it's too bad there's this tiny bit of configuration information missing.

  content: "VS: Sorry, I don't know how compiling works on Windows.<br /><br />Peter: the stuff you added to your .emacs file is almost exactly what the clojure-slime-config function does. Maybe if you set the <tt>clojure-src-root</tt> variable? I've had reports that for some reason on OS X that function doesn't work, but unfortunately I can't test on that platform. If you figure anything out please let me know."

It's unbelievably handy/addictive once you get used to it, but if you're not sure what's going on it can be pretty annoying.<br /><br />I meant to cover it in this post, but it got too long; I'll try to cover it in a future post. In the mean time, take a look at the <a href='http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/PareditCheatsheet'>cheat sheet</a> to see how it works.<br /><br />Peter: Sounds like the clojure-mode documentation needs a refresh. I'll take a look at that."

    I followed the instructions here to a tee (with emacs-starter-kit previously installed) and had problems starting slime.  No lisp was found.
    
    After a few retries, I noticed that if I had opened a .clj file, thus starting up clojure-mode, then slime would start up and connect to a clojure REPL without issue.
    
    Long story short:
    1. Follow the instructions in the post.
    2. M-x clojure-mode (or open a .clj file)
    3. M-x slime
    
    The above three steps work every time.

  content: Thanks for setting this up ... it's a huge time saver vs. starting from scratch!  One very helpful addition would be the ability to have Clojure and Common Lisp running in the same emacs session.  My .emacs setup was doing that until a recent Clojure update changed the way classpaths work; &lt;F5&gt; would launch an SBCL Slime REPL and &lt;Control&gt;&lt;F5&gt; would launch a Clojure Slime REPL in the same session.  Your contribution gives me a hands-off incantation for playing around with Clojure but I (and everyone else straddling the CL/Clojure boundary line) still need to come up with a way to get the two Lisps to coexist.

    This is really excellent work, thank you. I'm probably just being thick, but I can't get clojure-project to work. Everything works for me up until I try to run clojure-project. I get this:
    
    Symbol's value as variable is void: swank-clojure-extra-vm-args
    
    This is on Mac OSX with Emacs 22.3.1. I have no .emacs file and a fresh install of ESK.

  content: Finally got through some boneheaded errors, but seem to get one I can't resolve. When I do a M-x clojure-install, it looks like it references a git repo from kevinoneill, but there is not repo there. Rich Hickey maintains a repo on git now and I would think it should be pointing there, or at least to a 1.0 tag of that repo. Am I missing something?

    For my Win32 XP, I pointed to Rich Hickey, and wrapped all shell-command src-root args in a replace-regexp to convert forward to back slashes, a la:
    
    (format &quot;cd %s&amp;&amp; %s&quot; (replace-regexp-in-string &quot;/&quot; &quot;\\\\&quot; src-root)
    
    Note also the ampersands used by win32 batch language instead of semicolons.  I then setq'd clojure-src-root in my startup file, ran clojure-mode first, then slime.  Seems to work now.

    If you run into the error that M-x clojure-install cannot find the github repo, you have to manually open the clojure-mode.el and replace the kevinoneill user account with richhickey. Then everything works fine. So this is what the section in question looks like for me, line 616ff:
    
      (message &quot;Checking out source... this will take a while...&quot;)
      (dolist (cmd '(&quot;git clone git://github.com/richhickey/clojure.git&quot;
                     &quot;git clone git://github.com/richhickey/clojure-contrib.git&quot;
                     &quot;git clone git://github.com/jochu/swank-clojure.git&quot;
                     &quot;git clone --depth 2 git://github.com/nablaone/slime.git&quot;))

    I installed the ESK and Clojure via the instructions above.  However, when I type M-x slime, I get the following error:
    Search failed: &quot;[0-9]: \\([^$(]+\\).*?\\([0-9]*\\))&quot;

    I solved my problem with slime not starting up by adding this line to my personal configs:
    (clojure-slime-config &quot;/Users/chad/src&quot;) 
    instead of the suggested
    (clojure-slime-config)
    
    Apparently, clojure-src-root doesn't get set properly on Mac OS X.  This sets it explicitly in the call to clojure-slime-config.

    Perhaps I'm missing something obvious, but simple evaluations work, e.g., (+ 1 2 3). More complex ones do not. For example:

    results in:
