    Great post, thanks.
    
    You forgot to mention &quot;lein plugin install clj-stacktrace 0.2.3&quot; in the stacktrace section.

    The clj-stacktrace docs say,
    
    &quot;The :repl-options settings will cause clj-stacktrace to be used in the repl and swank.&quot;
    
    But exceptions inside of Slime (using swank-clojure) are still the &quot;old-style&quot; tracebacks, and they seem the same even if I manually (use 'clojure.stacktrace) and print the *e using their provided functions.
    
    Is there no way to get the pretty colored/sorted stacktaces *inside* of a Slime REPL/exception popup?

    My Trammel library has a total of zero users.  It's as obscure as they get.  :-)
    
    Nice post.

  content: Maybe you should move the &quot;lein plugin install clj-stacktrace 0.2.3&quot; line above the changes to ~/.lein/init.clj? If you follow the instructions directly, the plugin installation will fail, since init.clj will depend on an uninstalled library.

  content: Yup, that setup took nearly a full mntuie   Thanks Charlie. I upgraded my main laptop distro to Linux Mint Debian Edition (XFCE) recently, so I had to setup Leinengen once again. The Debian (testing) repos have an older version of Leinengen/Clojure, so I like this  manual  method anyhow. In fact, you could cut it down to about 3 seconds with the following one-liner, for most Linux desktop peeps (just run command as local user from the directory you'd like to hold the lein script):wget --output-document lein  https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/raw/stable/bin/lein  &amp;&amp; chmod +x lein &amp;&amp; sudo ln -s ./lein /usr/local/bin/The /usr/local/bin/ directory is already on the PATH for most (all?) distros, so I just throw a symlink there pointing to wherever the lein script wants to live.Cheers,Jamie
