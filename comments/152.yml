    I'm curious why you chose OCaml instead of Haskell.
    
    I'm intrigued by both languages. Whenever I'm thinking of doing a project in one of them, to learn more, I get the impression Haskell would be more educational because of its more radical design.

    algal: I'm sure Haskell is quite educational, but I knew up-front I was going to be doing at least a fair amount of UI, and I'm convinced the benefits of pure FP are much less of a slam-dunk in the context of UIs.
    
    Also OCaml has a reputation for being absurdly fast, while you hear of lots of situations with Haskell where pervasive laziness make performance unpredictable. Not terribly scientific, but there you have it.
