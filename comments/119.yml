  content: Thanks for doing this Phil!  I just finished the emacs tutorial to get the basics and your starter kit looks like it'll be a real godsend.  Can't wait for the screencast!

  content: "I am new to Emacs, and recently viewed the Peepcode screencast.\r<br />\r<br />I am using a recent build of Carbon Emacs running on Mac OS X 10.5.6.  Perhaps I have a set-up problem, but I have 2 issues I don't know enough to resolve on my own.\r<br />\r<br />1) Elisp functions that call external web browsers no longer seem to work.  If I launch Emacs without the starter-kit, type a full URL into the scratch buffer, move the cursor back to the beginning of the URL, then type &quot;M-x browse-url-at-point RET&quot;, my browser launches, showing the expected web page.  After I add the emacs-starter-kit to my home directory and create the linkage with .emacs.d and re-launch emacs, the previously-successful browser launch no longer works.\r<br />\r<br />2) The file emacs-starter-kit/elpa-to-submit/nxhtml/nxhtml-loaddefs.el contains references to a non-existant file &quot;../related/php-mode-2008-10-23&quot;.  When I change the references to &quot;../related/php-mode.el&quot; and re-start emacs and load a PHP file, the major mode switches to PHP/nxhtml.  However, because of issue #1, none of the PHP documentation commands (&quot;C-c RET&quot;, for example) work properly.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks for making time to help me resolve these issues.\r<br />\r<br />--Bill"
