    Thanks!  This was really interesting to me.  Didn't know about devilspie and it's exactly what I was looking for after giving up stumpwm.
    
    Incidentally, you have an empty link around the fullscreen text so it's just going back to this page.

    How did you attach the kneepads? Are they like skater kneepads? Did you experiment with hooks hanging from your pockets or a belt? What percent of the time do you not bother to put the kneepads on and just type on the laptop keyboard? (I'm thinking that might be a good way of telling how much better the keyboard pants really are)
    
    Why light color scheme in editor? Which font/size?
    
    Biggest weakness to me seems to be the wallpaper :) and that you're using weak laptop CPU/RAM all that time at your desk when you could just run unison, and the monitor isn't very big. For $1000 you could get a much better desktop machine with two &gt;= 24&quot; monitors.

  content: Self-indulgent perhaps, but its still interesting seeing how another person sets up their workspace. Are you also a Seattlite by chance? I also like a standing desk for work, although I haven't tried taping a split keyboard to my pants yet...

    Jeff: I retract my complaints about Mozilla in light of the latest nightlies--they are fast enough to make me turn my back on webkit. You can use Firefox nightlies to run Conkeror with &quot;firefox -app ~/src/conkeror/application.ini&quot;; highly recommended.
    
    Ivar: Yep, I'm in Seattle.
    
    John: The kneepads are basically skater kneepads, yeah. I don't think hooks would be sturdy enough; if the straps aren't tight it's very awkward to type on as you don't feel as sure of yourself.
    
    I use different color themes to distinguish between work/play instances of Emacs, so most of the time (at work) I'm using Zenburn, but my OSS stuff uses the default theme. I've been using the Inconsolata typeface for a while now; 11 point lets me have two side-by-side windows in Emacs.
    
    The 1.8 GHz processors in the Thinkpad don't seem slow at all to me. I have an SSD, so things are pretty zippy. I might feel otherwise if I used more resource-intensive programs, but as it is I would definitely not trade the portability and low power consumption for an unnecessary speed increase.
