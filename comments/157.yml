    Insightful interview, thanks for sharing.
    
    I am also into reducing mouse usage, but most of my tweaking goes to my Windows work environment. (If you ever have to use that, then look to AutoHotKey-L and Launchy).
    
    I just recently learned that pressing Alt-F1 and Alt-F2 in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Gnome pulls down the menu and runs a launcher, so I will be looking at your suggestions for inspiration.
    
    I would be interested in reading a brief overview about Nix from you. I gave it a go on Lucid Lynx but I gave up after successfully installing a minor package (zsync). Do you have your own list of package install &quot;recipes&quot; enabled by Nix? Or are your recipes shared with Nixpkgs?

    Definitely planning on posting more about Nix soon! I am using it for
    Mozilla, Emacs, tmux, ocaml, OpenJDK 7, and Leiningen so far.
