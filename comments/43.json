Info is there,  and the code is well-commented; it just takes some digging. I'd like to address this is a further blog post,  so stay tuned."}, {"timestamp":  "Fri Aug 31 18: 12: 30 -0700 2007",  "uri":  "",  "author":  "Fingal",  "content":  "I'd love to know how to do reasonably hip things with eshell,  but I'm at the level where all I can see is that normal lisp syntax (parens,  single quotes) doesn't quite work,  and I can't figure out how to invoke lisp functions on the results of primitive shell commands.
