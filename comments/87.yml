    Thanks Noah. It was working for me when I piped the output to /etc/hosts2,  but shame on me for not testing it all the way through. I also escaped the space,  but my blogging software must have munched it.<br />
    <br />
    Perhaps the pithiness of the original could be retained if it were ported to Ruby.

    Yes,  I do agree for the redirect!<br />
    And thanks for the portability information.

    This example has two major errors.<br />
    <br />
    Firstly,  you need to quote the argument to sed or you will get a &quot;sed:  -e expression #1,  char 21:  unterminated `s' command&quot; error.<br />
    <br />
    Secondly,  you cannot use sed to read from a while while concurrently writing to the same file. You need to use a temporary file in this instance.<br />
    <br />
    A working script would look something like: <br />
    <br />
    temporary_file=$(tempfile)<br />
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then<br />
        echo &quot;Could not create temporary file.&quot;;<br />
    else<br />
        sed &quot;s/localhost/localhost lolcathost/&quot; /etc/hosts &gt; $temporary_file;<br />
        mv $temporary_file /etc/hosts<br />
    fi

    Noted re:  redirects. There's a lot of things this blog software should do. =)<br />
    <br />
    Updated the example; thanks.
