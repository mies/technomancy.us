    Thanks Noah. It was working for me when I piped the output to /etc/hosts2,  but shame on me for not testing it all the way through. I also escaped the space,  but my blogging software must have munched it.\u003Cbr /\u003E
    \u003Cbr /\u003E
    Perhaps the pithiness of the original could be retained if it were ported to Ruby.

    Yes,  I do agree for the redirect!\u003Cbr /\u003E
    And thanks for the portability information.

    This example has two major errors.\u003Cbr /\u003E
    \u003Cbr /\u003E
    Firstly,  you need to quote the argument to sed or you will get a \u0026quot;sed:  -e expression #1,  char 21:  unterminated `s' command\u0026quot; error.\u003Cbr /\u003E
    \u003Cbr /\u003E
    Secondly,  you cannot use sed to read from a while while concurrently writing to the same file. You need to use a temporary file in this instance.\u003Cbr /\u003E
    \u003Cbr /\u003E
    A working script would look something like: \u003Cbr /\u003E
    \u003Cbr /\u003E
    temporary_file=$(tempfile)\u003Cbr /\u003E
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then\u003Cbr /\u003E
        echo \u0026quot;Could not create temporary file.\u0026quot;;\u003Cbr /\u003E
    else\u003Cbr /\u003E
        sed \u0026quot;s/localhost/localhost lolcathost/\u0026quot; /etc/hosts \u0026gt; $temporary_file;\u003Cbr /\u003E
        mv $temporary_file /etc/hosts\u003Cbr /\u003E
    fi

    Noted re:  redirects. There's a lot of things this blog software should do. =)\u003Cbr /\u003E
    \u003Cbr /\u003E
    Updated the example; thanks.
