    Except that the user experience of both Unix and EMACS is *awful*.
    
    Those two approaches lead to programmer-friendly apps rather than user-friendly apps.
    
    And believe it or not, the biggest problem when implementing extensibility in an application is usually *limiting* what the extensions can do, not the opposite - you still have to provide privacy, security, etc to the dumb user.
