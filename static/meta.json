<h2>Welcome to Technomancy</h2>

<p style='margin: 1em; clear: both;'>
My name is Phil Hagelberg, and I am a Free Software hacker<a href='#hacker'>*</a>.
<br />
<br />

I believe that the combination of the Internet and the precepts expressed in the <a href='http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html'>GNU General Public License</a><a href='#gpl'>**</a> has given rise to a distributed development model capable of delivering superior software and establishing a vibrant community of creative, collaborating programmers. My goal as a developer is to harness this power for my employers and contribute the fruits of my effort back to the community that allowed me to do it in the first place.
