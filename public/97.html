        <h3><a href='/97'>strike force: assemble!</a></h3>

        <div>
          <p>Another highlight of the <a href='http://technomancy.us/96'>time I
  spent at RubyConf 07</a> was hanging out with the Ruby Emacs
  crew. Interestingly enough, this included Matz himself, who regaled
  us with a great historical anecdote. When he was first starting out
  writing Ruby, he was coding the Emacs <tt>ruby-mode.el</tt> for it
  at the same time. He expressed some frustration with modes for other
  languages like Python and Pascal in which the editor could not look
  at a line of code and figure out where it should be indented to, so
  he resolved that Ruby as a language should not fall into that
  particular trap. With that in mind he chose the end keyword as a
  block delimiter so that it would be easier to write an Emacs mode
  for.</p>

<p>All that to say, Emacs and Ruby have a history that's been
  interconnected since the beginning. Recently I've noticed it seems
  that things have fallen into a state of relative disrepair. At the
  very least the situation could use some improvement. So the night
  after my talk I gathered anyone who was interested in Emacs/Ruby
  integration for a discussion. I was pleasantly surprised by the size
  of the crowd that gathered&mdash;for a while we even outnumbered
  the <a href='http://headius.blogspot.com/2007/11/is-werewolf-killing-conference-hackfest.html'>Werewolf</a>
  players. We started to put together a plan for how the state of our
  tools could be improved.</p>

<p>First off was the simple idea that we should actually use the
  mailing list that's existed for so long to
  communicate. The <a href='http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ruby_emacs_dev/'>emacs-ruby-dev</a>
  mailing list sees a short flurry of traffic after every Rubyconf,
  but it's silent most of the year. But we've never gotten quite this
  many people gathered in the interest of working together, so I think
  this could very well go somewhere. I like the idea of forming a
  focused 'Strike Force' for getting this done. Publicising a strong
  group identity creates strong motivation to see the project succeed,
  as evidenced by the
  <a href='http://rubyhitsquad.com'>Ruby Hit Squad</a>. The other big
  idea was to coordinate using the EmacsWiki. For a while we had a
  Basecamp project set up, but it quickly died. I think the lower
  barrier-to-entry of a wiki is worth the chaos that's often
  associated with it. It's especially true in this case because the
  EmacsWiki is already a prominent community establishment.</p>

<p>As for the actual tasks, a number of things were suggested:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>core ruby-mode.el and friends</b> - There's a certain set of
    elisp that actually comes with the Ruby distribution. It's quite
    helpful, but there are still a few bugs that you come across in
    day-to-day use, especially with <tt>ruby-electric</tt> mode. This
    could use some work and would probably be the best starting
    place since improvement here helps everyone.</li>

  <li><b>rails.el</b> - I was added to the developer list
    for <a href='http://rails-emacs.rubyforge.org'>rails.el</a> a few
    months ago. Unfortunately soon after I was put on a project that
    involved little-to-no day-to-day rails work, so my involvement
    (though not my motivation) in moving this forward has been
    slight. I'd like to open this up to the Strike Force with the
    understanding that Emacs conventions should be honored and
    <a href='http://emacs-rails.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/rails-cmd-proxy.el'>complexity</a>
    eschewed where possible. This would probably be handled by me
    reviewing patches as they come in, especially as things get
    started. I'm pretty opinionated about what goes into
    my <tt>~/.emacs.d</tt>.</li>

  <li><b>gem distribution</b> - It would be great to package up all
    the awesome ruby-related elisp for one easy installation. Building
    a gem for this would be the natural choice since Emacs-based
    packaging hasn't really gotten much traction and everyone who'd be
    interested in this would already have rubygems installed.</li>

  <li><b>rhtml-mode</b> - The focus on rhtml-mode has mostly been on
    syntax highlighting so far. It doesn't even have that perfect yet;
    embedded templating languages are notoriously difficult to parse
    in font-lock, but it wouldn't hurt to expand its focus to other
    functionality. Perhaps deriving it from nxhtml-mode would be good
    as this is (a) <a href='http://pluskid.lifegoo.com/?p=59'>most
    excellent</a> and (b) making its way into the core Emacs
    distribution soon IIRC.</li>

  <li><b>misc fixes</b> -
    The <a href='http://rubyforge.org/projects/ri-emacs/'>ri-emacs
    tool</a> is invaluable, but the delay upon the first invocation
    often discourages me from using it as often as I should. This
    could probably be fixed. Some have expressed a desire to fix up
    the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/smart-snippet/'>snippet</a> library as well. Getting these
    patched up, distributing them together, and submitting the patches
    back upstream would be great.</li>
  
  <li><b>augment integration</b> - As
    per <a href='http://technomancy.us/96'>my last post</a>, I've been
    working on a generalized system to get feedback from your code and
    display it back to the user in the editor. Naturally the first
    editor support I worked on was for Emacs. It's a bit buggy, so
    improvement and new functionality is a must.</li>

  <li><b>elunit</b> - What, you didn't think we were going to be
    writing all this code without tests did you? Tests are
    discouragingly rare in Emacs Lisp Land, but don't let that stop
    us. We're going to have to
    make <a href='http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/ElUnit'>elunit</a>
    rock so hard that elisp authors won't be able to help but use
    it. Am I making myself clear? </li>

  <li><b>documentation</b> - A lot of folks who are new to Ruby get
    intimidated by the initial face that Emacs presents new
    users. Writing up tutorials and perhaps even putting together
    screencasts would go a long way towards easing this pain. Emacs is
    the original environment for writing Ruby, but new users need a
    gentle introduction.</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, that's quite a lot of work. We talked about how to best get
  everyone involved, and it looks like tracking the project with git
  and using a rubinius-esque open commit bit would encourage
  participation. If this sounds like something you'd like to be
  involved in, please get on
  the <a href='http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ruby_emacs_dev/'>mailing
  list</a> and make yourself heard! Even if you don't code much elisp,
  there's still documentation, feature suggestions, testing, and more
  that you can help with. Watch this space as I'm sure to report on
  the project as it progresses.</p>
