        <div>
          <p>Well, I'm back in Seattle after a fun but grueling weekend in
  Charlotte, North Carolina
  for <a href='http://rubyconf.org'>RubyConf</a> 2007. This year's was
  as good as ever. Even though the number of attendees was about
  double last year's there still seemed to be that tight-knit feel
  that distinguishes it from RailsConf. The multi-track format forced
  a few hard decisions, but overall it was a definite win.</p>

<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/technomancy/1884018556/'
title='Photo
Sharing'><img src='http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2370/1884018556_931c01adc9_m.jpg'
width='180' height='240' alt='Cartoon Phil' align='right' /></a>

<p>Of course, this year was very different for me since I gave a talk
  for the first time. The organizers had anticipated the room being
  broken up into three smaller rooms for the multi-track portions, but
  there turned out to be four rooms. So one of the rooms was
  double-sized and could fit half the total conference attendees. This
  happened to be the room I was talking in, which was a bit
  intimidating at first, but once I got rolling my practice paid off
  and it went pretty smoothly.</p>

<p>The main downside was I found it hard to relax before my talk as I
  was constantly trying to find time to go over the slides/code and
  practice more. I foolishly chose a topic that needed a good deal of
  effort put into coding as well as just the talk, a path that I
  wouldn't recommend for other first-time presenters. I also took
  fewer <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/technomancy/tags/rubyconf07/'>photos</a>
  on the trip than I have on any other in the past, which was quite a
  shame. And then there's that feeling you always get at events like
  this where there's just so much going on, even apart from the
  talks. It's hard to know in the evenings how to spend your time; if
  you leave to use the restroom you're likely to miss something
  great. It's a wonder anyone slept.</p>

<p>The primary theme of the weekend seemed to be upcoming new Ruby
  implementations. Koichi's progress on Ruby 1.9 looked promising,
  although there was less time spent covering it than usual. I'd
  imagine that's because it's fairly well-understood by most and the
  initial release is imminent. The highlight of the conference for me
  was Evan's <a href='http://rubini.us'>Rubinius</a> talk, in which he
  explained the motivation and methods of his underdog
  implementation. Increasing the <a href='http://technomancy.us/81/'>turtle-factor</a> of Ruby
  is a big deal&mdash;for the first time committing to the core seems
  really accessible to your regular (skilled) Rubyists. It's really
  amazing that it's able to compete with the big corporate-funded
  implementations like JRuby and IronRuby. Part of that comes from
  <a href='http://www.engineyard.com'>EngineYard</a>'s amazing
  generosity in sponsoring the project, (which I imagine we'll hear
  more about soon) but I imagine part of that is just building off the
  work of really smart Smalltalk folks and harnessing the community
  via the power of the open commit bit.</p>

<p>Speaking of the open commit bit, distributed version control seemed
  to be an ever-present undertone. What with the oversaturated wifi
  network that you always see at conferences, it was really handy to
  be able to clone a local copy of the rubinius git repository in a
  quick minute without hitting the uplink. (Compare this to
  downloading a tarball of a Ruby 1.9 SVN checkout, which took over
  two hours over the Internet.)  There were a few Mercurial vs Git
  wars on #rubyconf, but it's exciting to see these ideas get more
  traction. (Check
  out <a href='http://topfunky.com'>Geoff</a>'s <a href='http://peepcode.com/products/git'>Peepcode</a>
  on Git if you're confused and looking to learn; it's quite
  helpful.)</p>

<p>The other theme I saw surfacing repeatedly was that of
  introspection. Lots of speakers seemed to be talking about ways in
  which to improve your own habits as a developer by
  self-examination. As a matter of fact, this included my own talk. In
  'Tightening the Feedback Loop', I talked about ways in which you can
  improve development effectiveness by decreasing the interval between
  the point in which relevant changes are made to your code and the
  time you find out about them. Basically it covered what metrics you
  should care about, how you should set up tools to measure them in an
  automated fashion, and the times and ways it would be best to bring
  those measurements to your attention. It ended with a demo
  of <a href='http://augment.rubyforge.org'>augment</a>, a project
  I'm working on to make it easier to apply these ideas of feedback.</p>

<p>Augment is a framework for gathering metadata from code and displaying
  it. The idea is that it has these backends, each which handles
  measuring a different metric, and it has some idea of when it's
  appropriate to do the measuring. There's then a set of frontends for
  various editing environments that bring the relevant information to
  your attention. In the future it will also record historical
  statistics for your project. Testing is the only backend currently
  fully implemented, but rspec, but flog, rcov, performance tests, and
  other backends are planned.</p>

<p>I've got
  the <a href='http://technomancy.us/static/feedback_slides.tar.gz'>slides
  up</a> for interested parties. I imagine you'd probably rather
  wait for the video to get posted though. <a href='http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/266002'>Confreaks</a>
  did an excellent job of recording all the sessions, and it looks
  like they're going to be posted with Creative-Commons licensing.</p>

<p>My talk seemed to be well-received; the double-sized room was
  almost full. I had a number of folk afterwards express enthusiasm
  about the ideas I had put forth, and a few wanted to contribute code
  as well; all very encouraging. If you're interested in these ideas,
  please <a href='http://rubyforge.org/mail/?group_id=4606'>join the
  mailing list</a> to discuss.</p>

<p>Also had some cool Emacs happenings at the conference, but this
  post is ridiculously long, so I'll save it for another one coming
  soon.</p>
