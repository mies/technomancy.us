title: hardware
content: <p>Well, I would have been more excited about this if it weren't for a bit of <a href='/100'>other big news</a>, but I recently upgraded my laptop to a <a href=''>Thinkpad X61 Tablet</a>. It's a pretty slick machine. Lenovo was having a pretty generous sale, so I couldn't resist trading in my <a href=''>T60p I got last year</a> for a newer model. The thing I missed most about my last laptop was the light weight. My T60 wasn't terrible, (about the weight of a Macbook Pro) but it was heavy enough to discourage me from taking it on the bus every day. This tablet is a 12-inch that is easy on the shoulders. It's got a low-voltage dual-core CPU and an extended battery, so it feels like it would last forever. It meant getting a 1.8GHz processor, but I'm barely noticing the slowdown, so it seems to be worth it.</p>
