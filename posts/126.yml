  <p>So it turns out getting set up to write Clojure code can be a
    little tricky. The
    current <a href='http://bc.tech.coop/blog/081205.html'>first hit
    for a search on <tt>clojure emacs</tt></a> returns instructions
    that are very out of date and far more complicated than
    necessary. There are a lot of disconnected tidbits about how folks
    have figured out how to configure things, but it can be a bit
    tricky to tell the difference between, "hey, this is how I finally
    got it to work" and "this is how you really should be doing it". I
    figure I know about as much about using Clojure with Emacs as
    anybody, so here's a run-through of how I've done my setup. There
    are a lot of moving parts, but bear with me; most of the
    installation is automated.</p>

  <h3>The Pieces</h3>

  <dl>
    <dt><a href='http://tromey.com/elpa'>ELPA</a></dt>
    <dd>The Emacs Lisp Package Archive functions as a centralized
      store for Emacs libraries and provides automated installation and
      upgrades.</dd>

    <dt><a href='http://github.com/jochu/clojure-mode'>clojure-mode</a></dt>
    <dd>This gets you syntax highlighting, indentation, and other basic
      goodies for editing .clj files.</dd>

    <dt><a href='http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/'>SLIME</a></dt>
    <dd>The Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs was originally
      written to support interacting with Common Lisp subprocesses from
      within Emacs, but it's been extended to work with other
      lisps.</dd>

    <dt><a href='http://github.com/jochu/swank-clojure'>swank-clojure</a></dt>
    <dd>An adapter for SLIME that allows it to work with Clojure.</dd>

    <dt><a href='http://github.com/jochu/clojure-mode'>clojure-test-mode</a></dt>
    <dd>This provides support for running Clojure tests from within
      Emacs buffers and seeing the results displayed inline.</dd>

    <dt><a href='http://mumble.net/~campbell/emacs/paredit.el'>paredit</a></dt>
    <dd>Paredit auto-balances parentheses and makes sure you don't
      end up with structurally invalid expressions.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h3>Installation</h3>

  <p>The easiest way to get started is to grab ELPA. If you
    use <a href='http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit'>Emacs
    Starter Kit</a> you've already got ELPA. (If you're new to Emacs,
    you might want to use the Starter Kit anyway as a base for your
    own customizations; also check out
    the <a href='http://peepcode.com/products/meet-emacs'>PeepCode
    screencast</a>.) Use <kbd>M-x package-list-packages</kbd> to pull
    up the package list. Move down to <tt>clojure-mode</tt> and
    press <kbd>i</kbd> to mark it for installation, then
    press <kbd>x</kbd> to go.</p>

  <p>Once it's installed you should be able to work with .clj files,
    and you may be happy with just this. (In fact, Rich Hickey,
    creator of Clojure, uses clojure-mode without any subprocess
    integration.) But most of us find it much more convenient to be
    able to interact with an actual running Clojure process as you
    code.</p>

  <p>Pressing <kbd>M-x clojure-install</kbd> will kick off the Clojure
    installation process. Once you choose a download location, it will
    download a number of repositories and compile Clojure itself, so
    it will take a few minutes. (It requires having git, Java 1.5+,
    and ant installed.)  When it's done, it will configure SLIME and
    swank-clojure, and it will give you instructions on a few lines to
    add to your personal config (usually found
    in <tt>$HOME/.emacs.d/init.el</tt>) so it will work for future
    sessions.</p>

  <h3>Usage</h3>

  <p>Hitting <kbd>M-x slime</kbd> will launch a new Clojure session in
    a <tt>*slime-repl*</tt> buffer. You can also interact with
    the <tt>*inferior-lisp*</tt> buffer, but the slime-repl buffer provides
    a higher-level interface with a few extra niceties. The REPL
    works as you'd expect, but you can hit <kbd>,</kbd> to activate
    some shortcuts, the most useful being <kbd>p</kbd> to change the
    current namespace (with tab-completion) and <tt>restart</tt>.</p>

  <p>Back in your .clj buffers, <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd> has been rebound to
    execute the form under the point in Clojure instead of Elisp. This
    is handy, but you won't get accurate line numbers from stack
    traces involving functions loaded this way. Pressing <kbd>C-c
    C-k</kbd> will load the entire file and ensure stack traces come
    through accurately.</p>

  <p>As you type out function calls, you should see their argument
    list show in the minibuffer. This is called <tt>eldoc</tt>, and
    it's a great way to get a quick refresher about what a function
    expects. For full documentation lookup you'll need to get handy
    with <kbd>C-c C-d d</kbd> though. Finally you can
    use <kbd>M-.</kbd> to jump to the definition of any given
    function.</p>

  <h3>Projects</h3>

  <p>Of course, after a while you'll be done with just playing at the
    REPL and want to hack on a real project. Since the JVM doesn't
    allow you to modify the classpath at runtime, you need to specify
    up front where it should look for code. The simplest thing to do
    is add <tt>src/</tt>, <tt>test/</tt>, <tt>target/dependency/</tt>,
    and <tt>target/classes/</tt> (for AOT compilation, if desired)
    directories in your project root to the classpath. Then you unpack
    your dependencies in the <tt>target/dependency</tt> directory
    rather than adding another entry to your classpath for every
    dependency that you need. Something like <kbd>unzip
    ../clojure/clojure.jar -d target/dependency</kbd> should do the
    trick; repeat for each dependency. If you've got complicated
    dependencies, you could
    <a href='http://github.com/dysinger/clojure-pom'>use maven to
    manage them</a>, but if you've only got a couple it's not hard to
    do by hand. Or stay tuned for a future post about a nicer way to
    handle dependencies; I should have something ready in a week or so.</p>

  <p>This elisp function will prompt for a project root and then
    launch a SLIME session configured with a classpath for that project.</p>

  <p>If you're using the starter kit, you'll already have it
    available. If you're on Emacs 22,
    install <a href="http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit/raw/b5d0aa78b87bde5866c4f834c61ecee3d1fdbc0c/dominating-file.el">this
    backported function</a>.</p>

  <h3>Tests</h3>

  <p>If you've written automated tests for your project using
    clojure.contrib's <tt>test-is</tt> library (which you should), you can
    use <tt>clojure-test-mode</tt> to run them. Install it
    via <kbd>M-x package-list-packages</kbd>, and then you can
    use <kbd>C-c C-,</kbd> to run the tests in the current
    buffer. Failures and errors get highlighted, so if you want to see
    details about a failure, move the point to the red region and
    press <kbd>C-c C-'</kbd>. Errors that occur <i>loading</i> the
    test will not be shown here; switch to
    the <tt>*inferior-lisp*</tt> buffer to see them.</p>

  <p>You can also switch between tests and implementation
    using <kbd>C-c t</kbd>. This assumes you've laid out your project
    so it has src/ and test/ directories in its root containing files
    that correspond to their namespace. The test namespaces should
    mirror the src namespaces with the addition of "test" as the
    second-to-last segment of the namespace.</p>

  <h3>Happy Hacking</h3>

  <p>I hope this is helpful and clears up some confusion. Now get out
    there and <a href='http://github.com/languages/Clojure'>write some
      code</a>.</p>
