{"timestamp": "Sat Oct 13 00: 00: 01 -0700 2007", "title": "the afternoon's hack", "id": 55, "content": "<p>Last February,  I started a project\n  called <a\n  href='http: \/\/dev.technomancy.us\/phil\/wiki\/RuseMail'>RuseMail<\/a> and\n  promptly forgot about it since I couldn't get the bindings compiled\n  properly. This afternoon,  I finished it.<\/p>\n\n<p>The formula behind RuseMail is really really simple:  FUSE + IMAP =\n  RuseMail. (The code is not <i>too<\/i> much longer than that\n  formula.) FUSE is a Linux tool that allows you to create filesystems\n  in userspace,  and IMAP is a mail protocol that (while internally\n  being hideously ugly to behold) allows a mailbox to be treated like\n  a file system. Sort of. (So far it's a read-only filesystem.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyway,  the code isn't much,  but once again it's the idea that\n  counts. Right? Give it a go if you're interested,  but note that\n  you'll need to\n  install <a\n  href='http: \/\/rubyforge.org\/frs\/?group_id=948&release_id=3876'>FuseFS<\/a>\n  (the Ruby FUSE bindings) for it to work.<\/p>\n"}
