    New features: <a
    href='/blog/rss'>RSS</a> and a search provided by Google. It's great:
    hoodwink.d saves me from having to code comments, and Google does
    search for me. Now I see why people are so excited about
    outsourcing.</p>

    I saw <a href='http://www.identity20.com/media/OSCON2005/'>a nifty
    presentation</a> from <a
    href='http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005/'>OSCON</a>
     the other day on what identity means and how that can
    be conveyed via technology. The presentation style alone is worth
    watching: it's very vibrant and active, totally avoiding the <a
    href='http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.09/ppt2.html'>Powerpoint
    Syndrome</a> and getting an interesting point across.</p>
