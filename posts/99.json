It's gotten to the point where\r\n  the gaps in functionality are a bit less crippling. But the more\r\n  interesting bit is that it's hosted at a publicly accessible\r\n  repository now,  so you can grab it if you're interested.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<pre class='code'>\r\n$ git clone git: \/\/git.caboo.se\/bus_scheme.git\r\n<\/pre>\r\n\r\n<p>I've submitted a <a\r\nhref='http: \/\/bus-scheme.rubyforge.org'>rubyforge project<\/a>,  and it\r\nshould get approved soon so I can upload to it. At that point gem\r\ninstallation should be possible with an ordinary,  everyday <tt>sudo\r\ngem install bus-scheme<\/tt>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point there are still some pretty hairy problems with\r\n  scope; the implementation is as na&iuml;eve as possible. Lexically\r\n  scoped it is not,  and closures are a ways off still. Basic &lambda;\r\n  functionality is a go. You can peek at <a href='http: \/\/git.caboo.se\/?p=bus_scheme.git;a=blob;f=test\/test_eval.rb;hb=7cd761db8b353e2a556d3c182d78b40c1a6e2164'>some<\/a> <a\r\n  href='http: \/\/git.caboo.se\/?p=bus_scheme.git;a=blob;f=test\/test_parser.rb;hb=7cd761db8b353e2a556d3c182d78b40c1a6e2164'>tests<\/a> to see how far along it is. Everything\r\n  uncommented should pass; commented tests mean \"to do\" items.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also,  I've tested it out and it works in Ruby 1.8,  Ruby 1.9,  and\r\n  Rubinius. A few folks on the Rubinius team have expressed interest\r\n  in getting it to compile down to Rubinius bytecode,  which would be\r\n  pretty exciting.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Much thanks<\/b> go to <a href='http: \/\/blog.caboo.se'>Courtenay<\/a> and <a href='http: \/\/scie.nti.st'>Garry<\/a> for helping get the repository public.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>REPL it up!<\/p>\r\n"}
