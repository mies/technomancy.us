title: in which slime and mire and other sludges come into play

  <p>I've been getting into Clojure more and more recently, and it's
    been really enjoyable. My learning project
    is <a href='http://github.com/technomancy/mire'>Mire</a>, a simple
    multiplayer text adventure. It's a great way to get familiar with
    the concurrency features of Clojure with a codebase that can still
    pretty small due to being text-based.</p>

  <p>Using SLIME to interactively develop Mire from within Emacs has
    been really slick&mdash;the level of interactivity is really
    impressive. The problem is, it's a bit of a bear to configure, and
    there are more moving parts than I'm comfortable with. I'm not the
    only one either; one of the most common questions in
    the <tt>#clojure</tt> channel is how to configure SLIME.</p>

  <p>I've worked on a bit of code to alleviate the confusion. There's
    nothing about the problem that's particularly tricky; it's just
    that the necessary code is changing so fast that using a package
    manager for it isn't feasible. And installing software by hand
    without a package manager&hellip; well let's just say it's fraught
    with frustration. So I've added an <tt>M-x clojure-install</tt>
    function
    to <a href='http://github.com/technomancy/clojure-mode/tree/installer'>by
    fork of clojure-mode</a> that should handle the necessary
    checkouts and configuration. It should save a lot of confusion
    for folks who are just getting started and not really sure of
    the best way to proceed.</p>
