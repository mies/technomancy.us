  <p>Last February,  I started a project
    called <a
    href='http://dev.technomancy.us/phil/wiki/RuseMail'>RuseMail</a> and
    promptly forgot about it since I couldn't get the bindings compiled
    properly. This afternoon,  I finished it.</p>
  
  <p>The formula behind RuseMail is really really simple:  FUSE + IMAP =
    RuseMail. (The code is not <i>too</i> much longer than that
    formula.) FUSE is a Linux tool that allows you to create filesystems
    in userspace,  and IMAP is a mail protocol that (while internally
    being hideously ugly to behold) allows a mailbox to be treated like
    a file system. Sort of. (So far it's a read-only filesystem.)</p>
  
  <p>Anyway,  the code isn't much,  but once again it's the idea that
    counts. Right? Give it a go if you're interested,  but note that
    you'll need to
    install <a
    href='http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=948&release_id=3876'>FuseFS</a>
    (the Ruby FUSE bindings) for it to work.</p>
