  <p>Oh yeah,  I almost forgot to mention this. I've teamed up with
    with <a href='http: //funkworks.blogspot.com'>Forrest Chang</a> to
    focus on polishing Emacs' Rails support. I've written
    up <a href='http: //technomancy.us/article/emacsrails'>a tutorial</a>
    (still in progress),  and there's
    a <a
    href='http: //dev.technomancy.us/phil/wiki/EmacsRailsTutorial'>discussion
    page</a> on my wiki where you can have your say. Forrest is
    planning on putting up some nifty screencasts,  so stay tuned.</p>
  
  <p>Also,  <a href='http: //planet.caboo.se'>Planet Caboose</a> is all official now.</p>
  
  <p>Lastly,  <a href='http: //xkcd.com/c73.html'>this web comic</a> is pretty funny.</p>
