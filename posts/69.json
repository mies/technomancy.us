I actually had a fairly lousy month\n  in December--for the first time in almost two years I went through a\n  month where I didn't feel at the end like I was at all better at\n  what I do than I was at the month's beginning. Sure, I had\n  learned <a\n  href='http:\/\/technomancy.us\/blog\/post\/68'>a<\/a> <a\n  href='http:\/\/technomancy.us\/blog\/post\/67'>lot<\/a>\n  about <a\n  href='http:\/\/dev.technomancy.us\/phil\/wiki\/ReadingList?action=diff&version=41&old_version=40'>Javascript<\/a>,\n  but that's mostly been about extending Firefox\/Conkeror and only\n  marginally related to What I Do.<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm sure most of this was due to the fact that I spent most of the\n  month looking for work or waiting for projects to get started. I\n  tried to keep busy with personal projects and whatnot, but when I\n  finally did start on a Rails job at the beginning of this month, it\n  was a bit distressing how rusty I felt. Part of this was also due to\n  picking up both RSpec (more on this in a future post) and the new Restful style, which was a bit\n  disorienting. (Though Geoffrey's\n  excellent <a\n  href='http:\/\/peepcode.com\/articles\/2006\/10\/08\/restful-rails'>PeepCode<\/a>\n  screencast helped a lot with that; give it a spin if you're having\n  trouble.)<\/p>\n\n<p>I'm thinking I should take this as a bit of a warning to practice\n  Pragmatic-Programmer-style continual learning. It was a pretty\n  jarring experience, but it helped remind me that staying sharp and\n  active is a really important part of maintaining competence. Falling\n  into complacency is easy to do, especially when you really feel on\n  top of your game, but it gets you nowhere.<\/p>\n\n<img src='\/static\/i\/t-desk.jpg' \n     alt='experimenting with inserting random images in my posts'\n     title='experimenting with inserting random images in my posts' \/>\n\n<p>On an entirely unrelated note, when I was first getting into Ruby (around RubyConf '05),\n  I <a href=\"http:\/\/technomancy.us\/blog\/post\/8\">joked about how \"Ruby\n    is becoming Lisp\"<\/a> because of some superficial changes\n  regarding how parameters were specified. Well it turns out some of\n  <a href=\"http:\/\/on-ruby.blogspot.com\/2007\/01\/will-rubinius-be-acceptable-lisp.html\">the\n    stuff they're doing with Rubinius<\/a> could make that a reality;\n    you should be able to feed the Rubinius straight S-expressions,\n    and from there it's a short leap to providing a defmacro\n    facility.<\/p>\n\n<p>Which is cool.<\/p>\n"}
