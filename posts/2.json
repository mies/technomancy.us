 Pragmatic Programmers</a> are publishing short, cheap PDF e-books focused

 first book</a> is not too exciting for me (I'm a GTK man myself), the next
 releases mentioned are all areas I'm very interested in. Kudos to the
 Pragmatic Programmers for breaking the rules of publishing <a

programming looks suspiciously like the <a href='http://www.gnome.org'>GNOME</a>
