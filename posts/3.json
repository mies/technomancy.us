I'm\nmajorly addicted to my delightful <a href='\/article\/7'>three-screen\nsetup<\/a> (don't try that, btw--it's insecure!) that I have at home, but I'm getting a\nlittle antsy from working at home all the time. I need to roam; maybe\nto work from a coffee shop or something. The problem is\nwhenever I'm elsewhere with my laptop, I always feel the like I'm\nbeing crowded into a small 1024x768 elevator.... there simply is no\nelbow room. Bah--it's my own fault for getting spoiled.<\/p>\n\n<p>\nAlso, I'm trying to <a\nhref='http:\/\/redhanded.hobix.com\/-h\/hoodwinkDDayOneForcingTheHostToAttendTheParty.html'>hoodwink<\/a>\nthis blog to no success. If any experienced druids could give me a\ntip, I'd appreciate it. (You can wink me at <a href='http:\/\/philisha.net'>my\nother blog<\/a> running Typo; that works just fine.)<\/p>"}
