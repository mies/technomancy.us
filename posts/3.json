OK, here is my problem. I'm
majorly addicted to my delightful <a href='/article/7'>three-screen
setup</a> (don't try that,  btw&mdash;it's insecure!) that I have at home,  but I'm getting a
little antsy from working at home all the time. I need to roam; maybe
to work from a coffee shop or something. The problem is
whenever I'm elsewhere with my laptop,  I always feel the like I'm
being crowded into a small 1024x768 elevator.... there simply is no
elbow room. Bah&mdash;it's my own fault for getting spoiled.</p>

Also,  I'm trying to <a

this blog to no success. If any experienced druids could give me a
tip, I'd appreciate it. (You can wink me at <a href='http://philisha.net'>my
other blog</a> running Typo; that works just fine.)</p>",
