There's\n  a <a href=\"http: \/\/yakuake.uv.ro\/\">Free alternative<\/a> if you're\n  into KDE and that jazz,  but if you're not it's ridiculously simple\n  to hack something up with existing terminal emulators in X. You just\n  need to install the <tt>wmctrl<\/tt> utility: <\/p>\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\nscreenid=<span class=\"string\">`wmctrl -l | grep screen | cut -f 1 -d \" \"`<\/span>.chomp.hex\n\n<span class=\"keyword\">if<\/span> screenid != 0\n  puts focused=<span class=\"string\">`xdpyinfo | grep focus | cut -c 16-24`<\/span>.chomp.hex\n  <span class=\"keyword\">if<\/span> screenid == focused\n    <span class=\"string\">`wmctrl -i -r <\/span><span class=\"variable-name\">#{screenid}<\/span><span class=\"string\"> -t 9`<\/span>\n  <span class=\"keyword\">else<\/span>\n    <span class=\"string\">`wmctrl -i -R <\/span><span class=\"variable-name\">#{screenid}<\/span><span class=\"string\">`<\/span>\n  <span class=\"keyword\">end<\/span>\n<span class=\"keyword\">else<\/span>\n  <span class=\"string\">`urxvt +sb -fn terminus-16 -bg white -e screen -A -h 10000 -xRR &amp;`<\/span>\n  <span class=\"comment-delimiter\"># <\/span><span class=\"comment\">replace \"-bg white\" with \"-tr -sh 90 -tint white\" for transparency\n<\/span><span class=\"keyword\">end<\/span>\n<\/pre>\n\n<p>I bind this to <tt>M-`<\/tt> in Sawfish and have some\n  window-matching rules that govern the sizing and placement of the\n  terminal window as it appears. I'm sure similar results could be\n  achieved in other decently flexible window managers.<\/p>\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n<span class=\"paren\">(<\/span>custom-set-typed-variable <span class=\"paren\">(<\/span>quote match-window-profile<span class=\"paren\">)<\/span> \n                           <span class=\"paren\">(<\/span>quote <span class=\"paren\">((((<\/span>WM_NAME . <span class=\"string\">\"^screen$\"<\/span><span class=\"paren\">))<\/span> \n                                    <span class=\"paren\">(<\/span>position 20 . 0<span class=\"paren\">)<\/span> \n                                    <span class=\"paren\">(<\/span>maximized . horizontal<span class=\"paren\">)<\/span> \n                                    <span class=\"paren\">(<\/span>frame-type . none<span class=\"paren\">))))<\/span> \n                           <span class=\"paren\">(<\/span>quote match-window<span class=\"paren\">)<\/span> \n\t\t\t   <span class=\"paren\">(<\/span>quote sawfish.wm.ext.match-window<span class=\"paren\">))<\/span><\/pre>\n<p>It's not rocket science or anything,  but I find it comes in handy\n  for all kinds of stuff. The wmctrl is a really nice utility if\n  you're into optimizing your workflow with automation,  which you\n  should be.<\/p>\n"}
