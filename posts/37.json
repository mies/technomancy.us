Planet Ruby was actually one of my main motivations to write <a href='http:\/\/rubyforge.org\/projects\/rplanet'>rPlanet<\/a>. Maybe as soon as I can get it a little more polished I'll try to see if I can convince Planet Ruby to move away from Python. I'm still a little star-struck to be listed up there with the &uuml;ber-hackers, and thus I don't want my code to be used until it's Good.<\/p>\n\n<p>The other thing is that I finally got my crontab working for <a href='http:\/\/hagelb.org\/railsconf'>Planet RailsConf<\/a>, so I thought I'd just  throw that out there. If you're going to RailsConf, you can <a href='http:\/\/wiki.rubyonrails.org\/rails\/pages\/RailsConfPlanet'>add your name to the roster<\/a> and you'll start showing up on there too. I'm using Planet RailsConf along with <a href='http:\/\/planet.philisha.net'>Planet Zacchaeus<\/a> (friends of mine) as a playground for doing new things with rPlanet.<\/p>\n"}
