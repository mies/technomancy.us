title: must be what it feels like to get old

  <p>Time for a little honesty here. I actually had a fairly lousy month
    in December--for the first time in almost two years I went through a
    month where I didn't feel at the end like I was at all better at
    what I do than I was at the month's beginning. Sure,  I had
    learned <a
    href='http: //technomancy.us/blog/post/68'>a</a> <a
    href='http: //technomancy.us/blog/post/67'>lot</a>
    about <a
    href='http: //dev.technomancy.us/phil/wiki/ReadingList?action=diff&version=41&old_version=40'>Javascript</a>, 
    but that's mostly been about extending Firefox/Conkeror and only
    marginally related to What I Do.</p>
  
  <p>I'm sure most of this was due to the fact that I spent most of the
    month looking for work or waiting for projects to get started. I
    tried to keep busy with personal projects and whatnot,  but when I
    finally did start on a Rails job at the beginning of this month,  it
    was a bit distressing how rusty I felt. Part of this was also due to
    picking up both RSpec (more on this in a future post) and the new Restful style,  which was a bit
    disorienting. (Though Geoffrey's
    excellent <a
    href='http: //peepcode.com/articles/2006/10/08/restful-rails'>PeepCode</a>
    screencast helped a lot with that; give it a spin if you're having
    trouble.)</p>
  
  <p>I'm thinking I should take this as a bit of a warning to practice
    Pragmatic-Programmer-style continual learning. It was a pretty
    jarring experience,  but it helped remind me that staying sharp and
    active is a really important part of maintaining competence. Falling
    into complacency is easy to do,  especially when you really feel on
    top of your game,  but it gets you nowhere.</p>

  <p>On an entirely unrelated note,  when I was first getting into Ruby (around RubyConf '05), 
    I <a href="http: //technomancy.us/blog/post/8">joked about how "Ruby
      is becoming Lisp"</a> because of some superficial changes
    regarding how parameters were specified. Well it turns out some of
    <a href="http: //on-ruby.blogspot.com/2007/01/will-rubinius-be-acceptable-lisp.html">the
      stuff they're doing with Rubinius</a> could make that a reality;
      you should be able to feed the Rubinius straight S-expressions, 
      and from there it's a short leap to providing a defmacro
      facility.</p>
  
  <p>Which is cool.</p>
