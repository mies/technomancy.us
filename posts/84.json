While this\r\n  doesn't have the same advantage of using any arbitrary USB\r\n  flash drive for storage like the Sandisk Cruzer MP3 Companion, it's still pretty cool.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\/static\/i\/ypu2.jpg\" alt=\"music player\" align=\"left\" \/>\r\n\r\n<p>It was about US$60 for a 1GB device in Indonesia. That is a pretty\r\n  decent start in that it has a screen and a very nice EQ. But the\r\n  really cool thing is that it actually plays Ogg files. I had thought\r\n  that there were only about five (hardware) players out there that\r\n  did, so I was pleasantly surprised to find this little device. I'd\r\n  actually been holding off on buying one because I didn't want to\r\n  have to standardize my library on MP3.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oddly enough,\r\n  the <a href=\"http:\/\/samsung.com\/Products\/MP3Player\/MP3Player\/YP_U2JZWXAA.asp?page=Specifications\">official\r\n  description on samsung.com<\/a> fails to mention this important\r\n  feature, instead yammering on and on about PlaysForSure. (blech)\r\n  Whatever. Apart from the silly name, it's highly recommended.<\/p>"}
