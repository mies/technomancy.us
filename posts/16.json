We are using Rails to set up a web interface to it. We need an experienced programmer to come help us out. You should have launched at least one Rails project and should be comfortable working with a team that is geographically scattered. You'll also need to be experienced with using Ruby (outside of just Rails) and Javascript. <\/p>\n<p> The main thing we are looking for is simply that you have gone through the process of launching a web application and have the skills necessary to prioritize and manage the project. <\/p>\n<p> This would ideally be a full-time job. Location is not an issue. <\/p>\n<p> Other skills that would be helpful include Linux server administration (lighttpd, postgresql) and experience with Trac and Subversion. <\/p>\n<p> If you think you are qualified, send an email to philh@paxtel.com with your resume. <\/p>\n"}
