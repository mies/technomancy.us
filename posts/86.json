I\r\nhadn't really felt the need for further affirmation in my path of\r\nchecking out Javascript more seriously on the server side,  but <a href='http: //steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/06/rhino-on-rails.html'>this\r\npiece of news</a> sure doesn't hurt. It's especially exciting to hear that\r\nthere are some really smart folks being paid big money to improve\r\nRhino,  one of Mozilla's Javascript engines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think Steve does a better job about explaining why JS is less\r\npainful on the server side; read up on it. (It's short for a Yegge\r\npost.) I'd love to see the core class extensions they've added in\r\nRhino; I wonder if that will be submitted back upstream. I know simple\r\nstuff like map is getting included in Firefox's JS engine; it actually\r\nmight be in it already. The other fun functions aren't tough to\r\nimplement; the real trick is getting them done in a consistent way so\r\nthey gain traction and mindshare. I kind of doubt if this Google\r\nproject has a great deal to offer technically\r\nover <a href='http: //helma.org'>Helma</a>,  (in fact,  if they copied\r\nRails' routing,  it could be at a disadvantage) but it's definitely got\r\nplenty of momentum and public attention pushing it forward,  which is\r\nat least as important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Side note:  Foo Camp looks awesome. Should be on the watch for any\r\nincarnations of Bar Camp in the area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also,  if you haven't read up on Javascript 2,  you need to watch\r\nthese <a href='http: //developer.mozilla.org/presentations/xtech2006/javascript/'>slides</a>.</p>\r\n"}
