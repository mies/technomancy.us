content: <p> So I was visiting <a href='http://whatisleftosay.blogspot.com/'>Luke</a> the other day,  and I wanted to show him something on his computer. ... double-click on the Terminal ... and I was rudely informed that I didn't have privileges to open the Terminal since I wasn't an administrator. I mean,  it's bad enough that they moved it out of the Applications folder,  but blocking access to it entirely is just plain silly. I mean,  what's the point of having a Mac if you can't use the Terminal? Sheesh.</p> <p> What happened to you,  Apple? <a href='http://download.lardlad.com/sounds/season11/bartfuture12.mp3'>You used to be cool</a>.</p>
