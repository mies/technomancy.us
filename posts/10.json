I was wearing a paper hat I had gotten at Ruby's, \r\nand it was getting a lot of comments. Then a Japanese fellow sat down\r\nnext to me,  started talking to me,  and took a photo. The thing is, \r\nthis fellow looked a great deal like Matz. (creator of Ruby) I was pretty excited, \r\nthinking I had the chance to talk with someone famous.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnyway,  after we had been talking for about five minutes the real Matz\r\ngot up and gave his keynote,  and I realized he wasn't the guy I was\r\ntalking to. I don't mean to offend this man--we had an interesting\r\ntalk--but I was a little disappointed. While I know they probably\r\nreally don't look much alike,  to a ang-mo^Wgaijin like myself\r\nthey could be long-lost brothers. It's not obvious in the photo,  but\r\ntheir beards are quite similar. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<p><a href='http: \/\/www.ok-cancel.com\/comic\/2.html'>This<\/a> made me laugh for a long time.<\/p>"}
