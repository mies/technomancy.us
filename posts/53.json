If you'd like to try it in development just to\n  confirm that it's working, replace \"rescue_action_in_public\" on line\n  70 of exception_notifiable.rb with \"rescue_action\".<\/p>\n\n<p>Anyway, give it a go. Plans for future improvement include AIM\n  integration (so far it's just Jabber) and the ability to fall back\n  on email notification if the user is not online.<\/p>\n\n<p>Oh, also I found out that <a\nhref=\"http:\/\/dev.technomancy.us\/phil\/wiki\/ebby\">Ebby<\/a> got mentioned\nin <a\nhref=\"http:\/\/applications.linux.com\/article.pl?sid=06\/06\/27\/1837234&tid=47&tid=13&tid=100\">a\nLinux.com article<\/a>. It was a pretty insignificant blurb, but it\nstill seems cool by my low standards. (I've never had any high-profile\nmention but for a quick link on RedHanded.)<\/p>\n\n"}
